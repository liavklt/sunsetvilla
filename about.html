					<h4>
						The Villa
					</h4>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">
						Sunset Villa was recently built and offers all the comforts.  There are three bedrooms, two with double beds, and one with 2 single beds. It has two bathrooms, laundry machine, air condition systems in the bedrooms, fully equipped kitchen, living room with a flat screen tv, parking space, wifi, and of course, it provides with the most stunning view that you can enjoy sitting on the front yard! </p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The sunset from Kalathas is absolutely wonderful and the villa is right next to Kalathas beach, not to say above!
					</p>
					<h4>
						The Neighborhood
					</h4>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">
						The seaside village of Kalathas is located 10km northeast of Chania, in the heart of a large natural bay on the Akrotiri peninsula. Kalathas has greatly developed in the recent years, since it is the ideal destination for locals and tourists who want to escape the noise of the city of Chania.
						Kalathas beach is at the edge of the village, very beautiful, with fine sand and crystal clear waters. There is also a small island, which can be easily reached by swimming. The beach is well organized with umbrellas, water sports, restaurants, mini markets etc.
						Aside from the main bay, there is a secluded part of the beach beyond the rocky end, which is not organized and perfect for those who do not want crowded places.

						Sunset Villa is right above Kalathas beach, very close to the city centre, only 10km away and 4km away from the airport. The bus stop for the public bus service is at the beach.
